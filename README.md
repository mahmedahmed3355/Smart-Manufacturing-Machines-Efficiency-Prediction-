## Smart Manufacturing Machines Efficiency Prediction

# Overview

This project focuses on predicting the operational efficiency of industrial manufacturing machines using advanced Machine Learning techniques. By analyzing historical machine data, sensor readings, and operational metrics, the system can identify inefficiencies, predict performance, and optimize manufacturing workflows.

# Motivation

Manufacturing industries face significant challenges in maintaining high productivity and reducing downtime. Predicting machine efficiency allows companies to:

Optimize production planning

Reduce energy consumption

Minimize maintenance costs

Improve overall equipment effectiveness (OEE)

This project aims to provide actionable insights to manufacturing engineers and managers.
